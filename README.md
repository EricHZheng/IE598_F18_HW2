# Fit a KNN and decision tree classifier to the Iris dataset
# Test multiple different K inputs, and try to identify the best choice of K for this data
# Different random_state will generate different result for best K based on accuracy number, since the selection for training and test sets is different. For my choice of random_state, the best K are from 1 to 17 inclusive
